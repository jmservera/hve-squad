## [0.12.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **The consumption ledger silently dropped every role but the last turn's, and still totalled
  correctly while doing it.** `consumption.md` has always used replace semantics, but nothing ever
  said where its rows come from across turns, so a rewrite could legitimately be built from the
  dispatches in hand. Under the pre-`0.11.11` wide table the Scribe worked around that by appending a
  new section per turn — accidentally correct, structurally non-conforming. The `0.11.11` split into
  two `Role`-aligned tables removed the room for that improvisation, and the ambiguity became visible:
  a nine-turn autopilot run shipped a ledger holding three rows, still headed with the seed run id,
  while every dropped dispatch sat intact in `history/`. Step 7.8 now derives the rows from **every
  consumption block recorded in `history/*.md` for the run**, summed per role, with the
  `orchestration` row summed from the recorded orchestration blocks rather than re-estimated. The file
  replaces; the rows accumulate (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`,
  `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`,
  `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
- **The ledger's own arithmetic check could not catch this, because a truncated ledger is internally
  consistent.** Verifying that the total equals the sum of the rows just written says nothing about
  the rows that are missing. Step 7.8 gained a completeness check — every agent with a history entry
  for the run has a row, and the ledger's run id names the current run — and Step 7.9 now treats a
  disagreement between the ledger total and `state.json` `currentRun.estCostUsd` as evidence that the
  ledger was left behind (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`).
- **The coordinator's self-heal only fired on a ledger still at its seed**, so a partially populated
  ledger carrying a plausible non-zero total looked healthy and no turn ever repaired it. The Step 1
  reconcile now checks three conditions and backfills on any of them: seed state, **truncation** (an
  agent with a history entry but no ledger row, or a run id naming a different run), and
  **divergence** between the ledger total and `state.json` `currentRun`
  (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
- **Per-dispatch consumption blocks were written in whatever shape each turn chose** — one run
  produced JSON blocks, YAML blocks, and a markdown table of `~8,400 (estimated)` values across three
  history files — leaving the aggregate unrebuildable even where the data existed. Step 7.6 now pins
  one container: an `#### Consumption` heading, a fenced `json` block, and bare numbers with no
  separators, approximation marks, or units (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`,
  `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **The squad could only cast agents this package or hve-core already shipped.** An **external cast** now lets a role resolve to a public marketplace resource without copying it in. Resources arrive by one of two tiers: **bundled** ones are pinned `apm.yml` dependencies a consumer gets by installing hve-squad alone, and **opt-in** ones stay behind an `apm install` command so nobody carries a vertical they did not ask for. Every entry passes a verification gate before it is registered, rejections land on a blocklist, and `github/awesome-copilot` is attributed in NOTICE. The first bundled entry is the `azure-pricing` skill, wired into Squad Cost Manager (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).
- **Two roles for capability that already shipped but was never cast.** `accessibility` assesses a product against WCAG 2.2, ARIA, Section 508, and EN 301 549 and discovers the surfaces that need assessing; `supply-chain` assesses how software is built, signed, and released against OpenSSF Scorecard, SLSA, Sigstore, and SBOM. Two new profiles package roles that already existed: `accessibility` and `modernization`.
- **The `full` profile did not contain everything it promised, and `privacy` was in no profile at all.** `full` now carries every role in the cast except the opt-in `backlog-executor` and the unbacked `devrel`, and `privacy` is seeded into `full` and `security`. GitLab, synthetic data, knowledge-graph research, and the code-review explainer and walkback agents each gained a route or a stated escalation.

- **Add-on packs, so a technology vertical no longer has to be a whole profile.** A profile carries the methodology spine and answers "what kind of work is this"; a pack carries specialists only and answers "what is it built on". Exactly one profile applies and zero or more packs layer onto it, so a vertical composes with `security`, `compliance`, or any other profile instead of multiplying the profile table by every combination. Three pass-or-fail tests decide which shape a new member set takes, and a pack selects catalog roles rather than defining them, so two packs naming the same role produce a deduplicated union rather than a conflict. `azure` and `modernization` stay profiles by decision.
- **A `power-platform` pack with two roles.** `pp-architect` designs the solution across Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages, Dataverse, and Copilot Studio, including environment and DLP strategy, data modeling, and ALM planning; `pp-connector` builds custom connectors and wires them into Copilot Studio agents. Both are advisory: neither runs `pac` against a tenant or publishes a connector. Both arrive through the opt-in external cast, so no consumer carries a vertical they did not ask for.
- **Five external cast rows and one blocklist entry, all gated against origin frontmatter.** Two Power Platform agents and three supporting skills are registered opt-in with their `apm install` commands, licences, and prerequisites. `azure-logic-apps-expert` is blocklisted: it declares three tools this project does not have and makes searching through them its first step, so it would answer from weaker grounding rather than failing — the same judgment already applied to the `microsoft-docs` skill.
- **Packs are offered, not remembered, and they come back off again.** The squad proposes a pack the way it proposes a profile: on the first run when the repository carries the domain's signals, when the request itself names the domain even in a repository with no such files yet, and later the first time a request needs a role only that pack provides. An offer is never an application. Dropping a pack is equally ordinary: it removes only the roles that pack still owns — never one the profile or another pack also contributes — appends a decision instead of editing one, leaves the append-only decision and history logs intact, keeps the removed member's row in the consumption ledger so the run total stays truthful, leaves produced artifacts on disk, and does not uninstall anything.
- **No Power Platform ALM writing role, and the reason is recorded rather than left implicit.** No verified resource can perform a solution import, and a role with nothing behind it is aspirational. Should one ever be added it inherits both existing write postures: opt-in seeding like `backlog-executor`, because a solution import is announced to everyone in the target environment, and preview-first execution like `deployer`.

- **Four squad roles for capability that shipped but nothing could dispatch.** `performance` plans SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, a load model, and a test matrix through the `performance-slo-planner` skill; `observability` designs spans, metrics, logs, their cardinality budget, and their PII handling through `telemetry-foundations`; `vuln-manager` triages CVEs against the product and drafts OpenVEX statements for human merge through the `vex` skill; and `risk-manager` produces a qualitative project risk register. Each carries a catalog row, a deliverable root, routing, a menu line, and a coordinator allowlist entry (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/`).
- **A charter may now follow a deployed prompt, instead of a good workflow staying out of reach.** Capability that ships as a `.prompt.md` is a user entry point that `runSubagent` cannot reach. A charter can now read the deployed prompt at dispatch time and execute it — never restating it, re-reading it each dispatch, and escalating with the slash command when the file is absent. `Squad Risk Manager` follows `risk-register`, and `Squad Azure Diagnose` follows `incident-response`.
- **Squad Azure Diagnose now leads the incident, not only the diagnosis.** It carries triage and severity, the existing read-only diagnosis, mitigation recommendations split into immediate and durable, and the root-cause record. There is deliberately no `sre` role: the diagnose phase was already this role's, and two roles claiming one phase is worse than one role doing more. The read-only posture is unchanged — mitigations are still handed to the gated `Squad Deployer` or to `Squad IaC Author`.
- **Two profiles that need no new capability.** `compliance` assembles security, supply-chain, vulnerability, privacy, responsible-AI, accessibility, and risk for an audit or attestation; `operations` assembles incident diagnosis, reliability, instrumentation, as-built documentation, and gated deployment for running a live system.
- **The five user-invocable reviewer agents were assessed and deferred, visibly.** `Accessibility Reviewer`, `RAI Reviewer`, `SSSC Reviewer`, `Supply Chain Reviewer`, and `Privacy Reviewer` are orchestrators over assessor subagents the squad already dispatches, so a charter would duplicate the coordinator. Each deferral is listed with its reason and the path that covers it.
- **The upstream drift guard watched agents only, while charters also bind to skills and prompts.** `Get-HveCoreCastDelta.ps1` now compares agents, skills, and prompts between two hve-core refs, reads `disable-model-invocation` on all three, and marks the delta breaking when the squad still references something the new ref no longer exposes. Without it, an upstream rename of a skill or prompt would pass the daily pin-bump check and release a squad whose charters resolve to nothing.

- **An `m365-copilot` pack with two roles.** `m365-agent-architect` designs Microsoft 365 Copilot declarative agents: capability selection, instructions, conversation starters, schema limits, and the choice between a JSON manifest and a TypeSpec definition. `m365-agent-integrator` connects that agent to the systems behind it through MCP server tools, Entra sign-in, and Microsoft Graph, and plans the tenant rollout. Both are advisory and stop at the handoff: neither provisions an agent nor publishes one to a tenant. Both arrive through the opt-in external cast.
- **Three more bundled skills, so a consumer who installs only hve-squad gets more without asking.** `gdpr-compliant` gives `privacy` the code-level engineering rules — data models, retention jobs, logging, pseudonymization — beneath the DPIA work it already does. `microsoft-agent-framework` and `semantic-kernel` give `developer` the AI application build side, which was previously absent everywhere. All three are pinned to an exact commit and none adds a runtime prerequisite.
- **A fifth bundled-tier test, so the rule reproduces the decisions.** A resource ships by default only if it also stays inside a product or platform the role already works in. That is what separates `semantic-kernel`, a library in a language `developer` already writes, from the Power BI skills, which would have `data-scientist` take on a separate product with its own tenant and licensing. Without it the written tests would have shipped an entire BI vertical to every consumer by default.
- **Twenty-eight more external cast rows, taking the registry to thirty-four.** Eleven of them are the role-strengthening harvest: `cost-manager`, `deployer`, `security`, `supply-chain`, `iac-author`, `architect`, and `azure-architect` all gain registered opt-in resources, each row naming its install command, licence, and exact prerequisites. The harvest proved the tier rule: nearly every operational Azure and GitHub skill needs an authenticated CLI, an MCP server, or a GitHub security entitlement, so it is opt-in rather than bundled.
- **Power BI, Fabric, and AI application engineering arrive as widened roles rather than as packs.** `data-scientist` now owns semantic-model review, DAX optimization, report design, and Fabric Lakehouse fundamentals; `developer` now owns building on Agent Framework and Semantic Kernel. No `bi-analyst` or `ai-engineer` role was created, because a second role claiming the same work is worse than a missing one. Fabric coverage is explicitly recorded as a Lakehouse primer, and requests outside it escalate instead of being answered from thin material.
- **Twelve more blocklist entries covering fifteen rejected resources, each with the failing check.** All four `power-bi-*-expert` agents declare `microsoft.docs.mcp` and make searching through it a mandatory first step, so they would answer from weaker grounding rather than fail — the same judgment already applied to `azure-logic-apps-expert`. `microsoft-code-reference` carries the same Microsoft Learn MCP dependency. `threat-model-analyst`, `agent-governance`, `agent-owasp-compliance`, `agent-governance-reviewer`, `custom-agent-foundry`, `agentic-eval`, and `eval-driven-dev` duplicate capabilities already deployed, and `eval-driven-dev` additionally requires running a bundled installer. `pinecone-rag` and `foundry-hosted-agent-copilotkit` are rejected because no role needs them.

- **A `qa-engineer` role that writes and runs tests.** The squad could review a diff and state test-authoring conventions for Pester, pytest, xUnit, and Rust, but nothing wrote or ran a test. `qa-engineer` plans coverage, hunts edge cases and hostile inputs, writes tests in the project's own framework and existing conventions, runs them, and reports reproducible defects with severity. The boundary against `tester` is stated in both catalog rows and both routing rows: `tester` reads a change and never writes a test; `qa-engineer` writes and executes them.
- **A `release-engineer` role that owns the pipeline.** Authoring and hardening GitHub Actions workflows (SHA-pinned actions, least-privilege `permissions:`, OIDC instead of stored secrets, concurrency and caching), CI cost and duration, environments and approvals, release trains, and rollout and rollback plans. It builds the pipeline and never runs a deployment: `iac-author` still authors the infrastructure and `deployer` still performs the Azure deployment behind the Impactful-Action Gate. The nearer boundary is against `supply-chain`, and both roles now state it: `supply-chain` assesses and reports how the software is built, signed, and released, `release-engineer` changes the pipeline that does it, and a pinning or token-permission finding from one is an input to the other. Its Azure DevOps reach is pipelines, builds, repos, and artifacts only; work items stay with `product-owner` and `backlog-executor`.
- **An `aws` pack with two roles, layerable onto any profile.** `aws-architect` designs AWS workloads and resolves across three verified agents by shape — landing zone and multi-account, hands-on service selection and CDK/SAM authoring, and event-driven serverless. `aws-diagnose` works a live incident read-only from CloudWatch alarm to evidence-backed root-cause hypothesis, recommending but never applying a mitigation. AWS is a pack while `azure` stays a profile, so a multi-cloud project takes `profile=azure` plus `pack=aws` and gets both instead of a false choice.
- **Thirteen more external cast rows, taking the registry to forty-seven.** Every row names its tier, install command, licence, prerequisites, and verification outcome, and all forty-seven were re-checked to carry ten non-blank columns. The registry schema now also states what its `Role` column means: it records which role's need earned the row, not who may use the resource, because an installed skill is reachable by every agent in the session. `github-actions-hardening` is the worked case — registered against `release-engineer`, bundled-eligible against `supply-chain`, and deliberately left opt-in because promoting it is a dependency-manifest change rather than a catalog change.
- **Four unselectable roles that say what the squad cannot do.** `networking`, `gcp`, and `identity` join `devrel` as listed-but-unselectable, each naming why and what would change it: `Network ISA-95 Planner` ships but cannot be dispatched and is OT-specific, the upstream multi-cloud material is AWS-only, and the only identity coverage upstream is two point tools that do not found a role. Cloud network resources stay inside `azure-architect` and `aws-architect`, and identity controls stay with `security` and `privacy`.
- **Opt-in roles now have two stated reasons instead of one.** `backlog-executor` is opt-in because its work reaches a live team backlog. `qa-engineer`, `release-engineer`, and every pack role are opt-in because their Primary is a registered external resource that is absent until the consumer installs it — which is why the `full` profile can still claim every non-opt-in role while carrying none of them.
- **Five more blocklist entries, one previous entry corrected, and two older entries now citing their gate step.** `playwright-tester` declares an MCP toolset this project does not expose and forbids acting without it; `scoutqa-test` is bound to a commercial hosted testing service; `quality-playbook` duplicates the deployed `code-review` capability, ships under its own non-MIT licence, and forbids the sub-agent delegation the squad runs on; `devops-expert` claims phases seven existing roles already own; `se-gitops-ci-specialist` belongs to an already-blocklisted plugin and duplicates two roles. The `custom-agent-foundry` entry's claim that it failed the declared-tools check is withdrawn as wrong — those are tool-group names this project does expose — leaving the collision, which was always sufficient on its own. The two plugin entries that predate the gate's numbering now cite step 5 explicitly, so every blocklist row points at a check the gate defines.
- **Deliverable roots reconciled end to end.** `security`, `rai`, `privacy`, and `modernizer` gain the roots their planners already write to, the four new roles gain theirs, and the roles absent from the table are now named with the reason they are absent: they return a structured result to the coordinator rather than writing a standalone artifact, so the Artifact Gate has nothing to look up for them.

- **A stated rule for choosing between a profile, a pack, and a federation.** All three add capability a single profile does not carry, and nothing said which to reach for. Now something does: one piece of work that needs extra expertise is a profile plus a pack, because those roles have to share a plan, a council, and a review; two streams of work with separate deliverables and owners is a federation. The rule is written where each mechanism is defined — the roster's *Pack or Federation* section, a *When a Pack Is the Answer Instead* section in the federation conventions, and a *Profile, pack, or federation?* section on the usage page — with a worked contrast: a Power Platform app that must pass an audit is `profile=compliance pack=power-platform`, not two sub-squads deciding one thing in two councils that never met.
- **The trap that rule exists to prevent is named explicitly.** A federation does not reach a technology vertical any faster than a plain squad does. Every sub-squad is seeded from a profile and takes a pack the same way any roster does, so building a sub-squad named after a vertical still needs the pack and adds a duplicated methodology spine, a second state tree, and a second consumption ledger for no extra reach.
- **Worked profile-and-pack combinations, so the pairing is no longer guesswork.** Seven rows covering greenfield Power Platform, Power Platform under audit, AWS design, a multi-cloud estate, AWS on-call, an M365 Copilot agent handling personal data, and two verticals applied at once. Two of them are cases a profile could never have served: `operations` plus `aws` gives one squad both cloud troubleshooters, and the last applies two verticals where a single-choice profile forces you to pick one.
- **`data-scientist` is now seeded by the `product` profile as well as `full`.** The six Power BI and Fabric skills registered against that role previously sat behind a role that one profile out of eleven carried, which made a whole analytics vertical effectively undiscoverable. Product discovery routinely needs data profiling and a notebook, so the role belongs there. `product` now carries all seven deliverable-producing roles, which it was already fanning out across.
- **How to reach a vertical that is not a pack is now written down.** Power BI and Fabric arrive on `data-scientist` and AI application engineering on `developer`, because no upstream agent behind either passed the verification gate. `developer` is in every profile, so that side is always present; `data-scientist` is seeded by `full` and `product`, and anywhere else the coordinator offers to add the role when a Power BI, DAX, Fabric, or Lakehouse request matches its routing row. The roster and the usage page both state that this is discovered at the moment of need rather than at build time, which is the honest cost of a vertical that could not become a pack.

## [0.11.14] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Contributor pull requests conflicted on `apm.yml` and `CHANGELOG.md` every time two landed together.** Version and changelog are now release outputs assembled on `main` from per-pull-request fragments under `.changes/unreleased/`, so nothing in a pull request touches shared release state (`scripts/New-ChangeFragment.ps1`, `scripts/Invoke-ReleasePrep.ps1`, `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`, `.github/workflows/release-prep.yml`).

### Fixed

- **The first Release Prep run failed with `Not found: -GitHubOutput`.** The workflow built its arguments as a PowerShell array and splatted it, but array splatting binds *positionally* — so the literal string `-GitHubOutput` landed in the script's first positional parameter, `-ApmFile`, and the existence check threw on a file by that name. The workflow now splats a hashtable, which binds by name (`.github/workflows/release-prep.yml`).

## [0.11.12] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **The squad could plan an Azure DevOps or Jira backlog but never write it, and the handoff dead-ended at the user.** `ADO Backlog Manager` and `Jira Backlog Manager` are `disable-model-invocation: true` entry points that `runSubagent` cannot reach, and the only dispatchable ADO agent (`AzDO PRD to WIT`) holds read-only tools by design, so the roster's `product-owner` row told the coordinator to escalate the tracker write and stop. A new **`Squad Backlog Executor`** charter closes that gap the same way `Squad Deployer` closed it for Azure: it takes a finalized `handoff.md`, previews every create, update, and link read-only, sanitizes internal tracking paths and planning IDs out of the outbound fields, searches the live tracker for probable duplicates, stops at the Impactful-Action Gate with the full preview and item count, and only then writes — against the resumable `handoff-logs.md` checkbox ledger, so a batch that fails at item 23 resumes instead of re-creating (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-backlog-executor.agent.md`).
- **The new `backlog-executor` role is opt-in and belongs to no profile, not even `full`.** A tracker write is announced to a whole team by notifications, subscriptions, and webhooks the moment it lands, so the role never arrives by default. Instead the coordinator *offers* it: when a request matches a tracker-write pattern in a squad that does not carry the role, it proposes adding it — naming the tracker and project it would write to — and continues the turn on acceptance. This reuses the offer-on-demand path that already existed for `intake-validator`, now generalized as **Opt-In Roles** in the roster conventions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`).
- A **Tracker-Write Gate** in the routing conventions: only `backlog-executor` writes to a tracker, a finalized handoff is a precondition, one approval covers one batch, and an unattended Watch Mode run completes the preview and stops because the Impactful-Action Gate never proceeds there (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`).
- A **`tracker-write` capability with no fallback** — the only such row in the capability map. Every other capability is a read, where reaching the same data another way beats blocking; a write is not, so an absent ADO MCP or `jira` skill returns `blocked` rather than falling back to REST with a user-supplied PAT. Read access and write access stay separate grants (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`).

### Changed

- Live issue-tracker writes are now named explicitly in the Impactful-Action Gate definitions carried by both coordinators and by the Watch Mode unattended-disposition table, rather than being covered only by the general "irreversible side effect" clause (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`).
- The autopilot deliverable fan-out rule no longer cites `product-owner` as the role that creates work items in a live tracker; that role plans the backlog and stops at the handoff, and the gated write belongs to `backlog-executor` (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`).
- The documentation site gained a **Backlog writes (Azure DevOps and Jira)** section walking the ask → accept the role → review the preview → check duplicates → approve sequence, plus the two deliberate limits (no MCP fallback, no unattended write). The `full` profile row no longer claims "all deployed roles" now that an opt-in role exists outside every profile, and the unattended Impactful-Action Gate list names tracker writes (`docs/usage.html`, `docs/maintaining.html`).

[0.11.12]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.11.12

## [0.11.11] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **The consumption ledger had grown to a single 15-column table, which is unreadable at the width it renders.** `Role, Member, Agent, Model, Model Source, Priced As, Tier, Turns, In Tokens, Cached, Cache Wr, Out Tokens, Est. Cost (USD), Est. Credits, Basis` accumulated across the `0.11.4`-`0.11.7` consumption work one column at a time, and no single change was large enough to notice. The markdown was structurally valid, so nothing flagged it; the defect was that a ledger a consumer is meant to read at a glance forced horizontal scrolling instead. `consumption.md` is now **two narrower tables that both key on `Role` in roster order**, so a row in one lines up with the same row in the other: **Attribution** (Role, Member, Agent, Model, Model Source, Priced As, Tier) records who ran on what, and **Usage & Cost** (Role, Turns, In Tokens, Cached, Cache Wr, Out Tokens, Est. Cost (USD), Est. Credits, Basis, plus the run-total row) records what it cost. No figure, rate, or calculation changed (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`).
- The tier-fallback table in the shipped `consumption-rates.md` template had ragged cell padding, so the raw markdown was hard to read even where the rendered output was fine (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

## [0.11.7] - 2026-07-30

Closes five loopholes in the `0.11.4` consumption work and makes model attribution fully automatic. The rate table and the resolution ladder shipped correctly, but each left the Scribe a legal path to the wrong answer — observed on a real `product` sub-squad run that reported **$2.58** against a true cost plausibly in the **$25-45** range.

### Fixed

- **The dispatch-size floors were written as fallbacks, so they were never applied.** `0.11.4` said to use the class defaults "only when the dispatch reported nothing." The Scribe always has *something* — the coordinator's summary — so it sized every dispatch from that summary and never reached the table. The result was derived average contexts of 8,000-13,000 tokens against class floors of 40,000-60,000, roughly **5-7x low on every row**. The class rows are now **floors, not fallbacks**: start at the floor, raise with what the dispatch reported, never record below it. A **validity check** makes the failure self-detecting — `gross_input / internal_turns` below the class `base_context` means the floor was skipped, and the numbers are raised and recomputed rather than written (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`).
  - The reason the summary is the wrong ruler is now stated explicitly: it is a report *about* a dispatch, not the context the dispatch ran on. The Scribe never sees the dispatched agent's internal loop, and an agent's prompt plus auto-applied instructions already exceeds most floors before it reads a single file.
- **`sessionModel` accepted the literal string `unknown`, and nothing populated it.** A squad ran a full autopilot pass with `"sessionModel": "unknown"` in `state.json`, so every agent without pinned frontmatter fell through to `unresolved` and was priced at a tier fallback — work that actually ran on Opus 5 billed as Sonnet 4.6, a **~1.7x undercount** compounding the sizing error. The coordinator now records the session model **automatically, by self-reporting the model it is itself running on**, and re-reports it every turn so a mid-run switch is picked up. No build question is added: the coordinator runs *on* the session model, so the answer was always in its possession, and a squad that interrogates its operator about facts it can observe is a squad that gets skipped (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
- **Nothing asked the dispatches themselves.** Model identity and internal tool-call count are known only to the dispatched agent — the coordinator sees a summary, never the agent's internal loop. Every dispatch is now asked to close its response with both, and a new **`dispatch-reported`** rung carries the result. It outranks frontmatter, because frontmatter lists *preferences* while the runtime picks the first entry the plan actually supports — only the dispatch knows which one it got.
- **`unresolved` was recorded without walking the ladder.** The same run marked all six rows `unresolved` while three of them dispatched agents that pin a model on disk — `Squad Researcher` and `Squad Lead` pin Claude Sonnet 5, and were billed as Haiku 4.5 and Sonnet 4.6 respectively. `unresolved` is now **earned, not assumed**: it requires that the dispatch reported no model, the agent file was opened and carried no `model:`, *and* `state.json` held no usable `sessionModel`. Every rung is an observation or a file read, so a ledger of uniform `unresolved` rows is a defect rather than a gap.
- **Ledger totals were estimated instead of added.** The observed run's total row was wrong in every column (In by 11,500, Cached by 37,000, Cache Wr by 7,500, Out by 938) while each individual row's cost math was correct, and the comparison prose quoted **$2.30** against a table total of **$2.58**. The Scribe now computes the total by summing the rows it just wrote and verifies before saving that each column equals its rows and that the prose figure is the same number as the table's. `basis` is also constrained to exactly one value — the run emitted the invalid combined `estimated, tier-default`.

### Changed

- **Model resolution is now fully automatic and asks nobody anything.** The ladder is `cli-pinned` → `operator-declared` → `dispatch-reported` → `agent-pinned` → `session-inherited` → `unresolved`, and every rung is an observation or a file read. Reported display names are normalized against `consumption-rates.md` (case- and punctuation-insensitive, `(copilot)` suffix ignored), falling to the nearest row in the same family when the table has not caught up — `model` keeps the reported name and `priced_as` records the row charged, so a stale rate table is visible rather than silently rounding attribution.
- **Automatic model selection is handled as a routing mode, not a model.** Under `auto` the host routes *per request*, so a single run-level model is wrong by construction: `sessionModel` records `auto` verbatim and is never expanded into a concrete name. Pinned agents are unaffected, because frontmatter still wins over the picker. Unpinned dispatches can then be resolved only by their own report — which is exactly why every dispatch is now asked for one. A dispatch that reports nothing under `auto` is flagged `auto-unreported` on the ledger and called out as the least trustworthy figure on the page, since auto routes agentic tool loops toward capable models more often than cheap ones. No heuristic guesses a better number: the remedy is the report.
- **The shipped estimator template gained the `Growth/turn` and `Output/turn` columns its own formulas reference**, and the formula block moved to the closed form (`average_context`, `gross_input`, `cache_write_tokens`, `output_tokens`) already used by deployed rate files. The template previously published a two-column table that could not drive the calculation it documented (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

Copied to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/squad-task.yml`, it adds a "Squad task" option to a consumer's New Issue page that pre-applies the `squad/auto` trigger label at creation — a convenience only, never a requirement: hand-labeling any ordinary issue still starts a run the same way. Documented in `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md` (*Headless Runtime Requirement*) and `docs/usage.html` (*Optional: a New Issue template for `squad/auto`*).

## [0.11.4] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **The consumption ledger reported roughly one-fiftieth of what a run actually cost, and the drift was undetectable by design.** `consumption-rates.md` is seeded from a template only when the file is *missing*, so a table that exists in the wrong shape is used forever. A drifted table that priced every tier at one blended `~$0.005/1k` rate survived indefinitely, and with it three compounding errors: model choice had no effect on cost (an Opus dispatch and a Haiku lookup billed identically), there were no separate cached, cache-write, or output rates although output runs 5-15x input on every model, and every dispatch was recorded at a flat per-tier token constant so the ledger was really `dispatch_count × constant`. The Scribe now **shape-validates** the table — per-model rows with `Input`, `Cached`, `Cache write`, and `Output` columns, a tier-fallback table, a dispatch-size estimator, and a calibration block — and reseeds when the check fails, preserving the calibration block (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
  - **A dispatch was priced as a single model call.** This was where the order of magnitude went. A dispatched agent runs an internal tool loop, and every turn resends the accumulated context, so cost scales with `internal_turns × average_context` — largely at the cached rate — not with one input-and-output pair. The new dispatch-size estimator models the loop explicitly, derives its inputs from what the dispatch actually reported (files read and their size, artifacts written, tool calls made, findings length), and records the `internal_turns` it assumed on every block.
  - **Running the squad was free.** The coordinator's own turns and every Scribe write consumed tokens that no dispatch block covered. The ledger now carries an `orchestration` row.
  - **Anthropic cache-write tokens were never billed.** Anthropic models charge a cache-write rate on top of cached input (Haiku 4.5 $1.25, Sonnet 4.6 $3.75, Opus 5 $6.25 per 1M); the rate had no column and no term in the formula.
- **The ledger invented models that were never dispatched.** With no source of truth for what actually ran, `model` was filled from the tier-fallback table's "priced as" column — so an operator running Opus 5 everywhere saw roles attributed to Sonnet 4.6 or Haiku, with costs to match. Model identity is deterministic and readable, so it is now **resolved, never guessed**, through an explicit ladder, and `model` accepts only a resolved value or the literal `unknown` (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md` *Model Attribution*).
  - **A tier is not a model.** `Model Tier` is a routing preference that never determines what ran and never becomes a model name. A dispatch that inherited a high-capability session model is now priced at that model's rates rather than its roster tier's — pricing an inherited frontier dispatch at a mid-tier fallback was a direct undercount. Tier rates apply only when `model` is `unknown`.
  - **Attribution and pricing are now separate fields.** `model` records what ran; `priced_as` records the rate row used. They differ only on a fallback, and copying `priced_as` into `model` is explicitly prohibited in both the state instructions and the rate table itself.
- **Unattended runs would have misattributed every model-pinned role.** The Watch Mode workflow passes `--model` to the Copilot CLI, which ignores agent `model:` frontmatter entirely, so in a headless run the pinned lightweight agents (Scribe, Reviewer, Cost Manager, Technical Writer) all execute on the one CLI model. Resolution is now host-aware: a `cli-pinned` rung takes precedence when `state.json` carries a `trigger` object, ahead of the frontmatter rung the VS Code host honors.

### Added

- **A calibration loop, so the estimate converges instead of staying wrong.** `consumption-rates.md` carries a `calibration_factor` — the running mean of `observed_credits / estimated_credits`, clamped to 0.25-10.0 — that multiplies every cost estimate. Hand the Scribe an `observed_credits` figure (the per-user `ai_credits_used` delta from the Copilot usage-metrics REST API) and it folds that run's ratio into the mean. Until one run is reconciled the factor stays at 1.00 and the ledger reads "uncalibrated".
- **Real per-model rates**, verified against the GitHub Copilot "Models and pricing" documentation on 2026-07-29, covering the GPT-5.4 family, Claude Haiku 4.5 through Opus 5, Gemini 3.1 Pro, and GPT-5.5, with input, cached, cache-write, and output columns.
- **`model_source` on every consumption block**, recording which rung resolved the model (`cli-pinned`, `operator-declared`, `agent-pinned`, `session-inherited`, or `unresolved`). This is what makes a legitimately pinned Haiku row distinguishable from a fabricated one — previously they looked identical.
- **`currentRun.sessionModel` and `currentRun.modelOverrides` in `state.json`**, the recorded source of truth for inherited dispatches. The coordinator captures the session model at Init and restates it when the operator switches models; sub-squads inherit both from the federation root unless they set their own.

### Changed

- **`state.json` `schemaVersion` moves to `1.3` (squad) and `1.2` (federation).** Both additions are backward-compatible: the new fields default to empty and existing state stays valid.
- **The per-dispatch consumption block gains six fields** — `model_source`, `priced_as`, `internal_turns`, `cache_write_tokens`, `cache_write_rate`, and a `basis` that now describes pricing only while `model_source` describes attribution. The `consumption.md` ledger gains matching `Model Source`, `Priced As`, `Turns`, and `Cache Wr` columns plus the `orchestration` row.
- **The squad-versus-manual cost comparison is materially less flattering, and honest for the first time.** The old figure undercounted the squad while modelling the manual baseline generously. Pricing both sides through the same estimator puts the saving near 13%, resting on tier routing and reduced rework rather than a large raw-token advantage.

### Upgrade note

`cost-ceiling=$X` is not just reporting — it is wired to the Risk Gate in autonomous, autopilot, watch-mode, and federation runs. Because estimates now land roughly 50x higher, **any ceiling you already set will trip almost immediately** and halt runs that previously completed. The shipped default is unset, so a fresh install is unaffected; if you carry a value in `routing.md` or pass one to `/squad`, re-baseline it against a current `consumption.md` total before assuming the run is at fault (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autonomous.instructions.md`).

## [0.11.2] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **The `researcher` role pointed at a delegated lane worker, so the Research stage could never produce its artifact.** `0.11.0` gave `lead`, `developer`, `tester`, and `technical-writer` squad-owned charters when their hve-core agents became skills, but repointed `researcher` straight at `RPI Researcher`. That agent is not a research orchestrator: it executes one bounded lane and returns `Blocked` without writing unless the dispatch supplies a cycle number, a wave type, one lane type, an exact lane path, and a **distinct parent primary artifact path** that only a parent can create. A role-scoped dispatch supplies none of those. The same commit assigned the role a Deliverable Root of `.copilot-tracking/research/<date>/` — a path that agent is contractually forbidden to write. `researcher` now resolves to the new `Squad Researcher` charter (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).
  - This was the root of a wider failure, not an isolated one. The Artifact Gates chain research → plan → implement, so a Research stage that can never produce its artifact makes **every downstream gate unsatisfiable**. A run instructed to proceed end-to-end then narrates past the gates instead of stopping: intake verdicts written outside `decisions.md`, no plan artifact, no `lead` or `tester` history entry, and deliverables presented for final approval that no gate ever cleared.
- **Four other charters delegated lookups straight to the same lane worker.** `Squad Cost Manager`, `Squad Modernization Planner`, `Squad IaC Author`, and `Squad Azure Diagnose` each declared `RPI Researcher` in `agents:` and asked it for pricing, version, AVM, and Azure-resource lookups with plain prompts, hitting the identical guard. All four now delegate to `Squad Researcher`, as does every non-MCP fallback in the capability map (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`).

### Added

- **`Squad Researcher`** — the parent the research stage was missing. It runs the `rpi-research` skill, creates the primary artifact **before** delegating so the worker's preflight can succeed, decomposes the request into bounded lanes, dispatches `RPI Researcher` once per lane with the full delegated-input contract, and synthesizes the lanes back into the primary artifact with the canonical `C#` and `W#` identifiers the worker is forbidden to assign.
- **`Squad Challenger`** — fills the `challenger` role, vacant since `Task Challenger` was retired. Runs `rpi-challenger` for assumption and reasoning critique and `rpi-plan-critique` for plan-versus-research verification, restoring the capability the retired `Plan Validator` provided. Returns objections graded blocking, material, or minor.
- **`Squad Prompt Engineer`** — fills the `prompt-engineer` role. Routes to `prompt-builder`, `prompt-refactor`, or `prompt-analyze` by request shape, and defaults to analysis when authoring intent is ambiguous.
- **A `Worker Agents Are Not Roles` rule in the roster.** Dispatchability was necessary but not sufficient: an agent can be `user-invocable: false` and still refuse every role-scoped dispatch because it validates a delegated-input contract first. Such workers may never be a Primary or an Alternate. The rule also names the detection test — a role whose Deliverable Root its Primary cannot write is a wrong row (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).

### Changed

- **`researcher` moves from the `fast` tier to `default`.** The charter constructs the delegated contract and performs cross-lane synthesis; the volume stays cheap because the lanes it dispatches run on `RPI Researcher`, which carries its own fast-model preference. Cheap lanes, competent synthesizer.
- **`challenger` and `prompt-engineer` join the `full` profile and the custom-roster menu**, and both gain routing rules. `devrel` remains unselectable and is now labelled accurately: it has no agent **and no backing skill**, so a charter there would invent a capability rather than expose one.
- **The `team.md` seed template in the squad skill gains the `Deliverable Root` column** the roster schema has required since `0.11.0`, and lists the full catalog including the three restored roles (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

[0.11.2]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.11.2

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-28

> **Superseded — use 0.11.2 or later.** The `researcher` role still resolves to a delegated lane worker that cannot accept a role-scoped dispatch, so the Research stage produces no artifact and every downstream Artifact Gate is unsatisfiable. Fixed in 0.11.2.

### Fixed

- **Federation Init never asked how to name the members of each sub-squad.** The single-squad Init makes naming a numbered Phase 1 step with an explicit wait-for-the-user gate; the federation delegated it as three words (`propose/confirm the roster and naming`) buried inside a Phase 2 *Create* step, so a build wrote `team.md` with an empty `Member Name` column without the user ever seeing the choice. This is the same defect the approval-channel capture had before `0.10.12`. Naming is now **Federation Init Phase 1 step 5** with the four choices inlined and its own wait gate, and Phase 2 passes the captured policy down (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - New **ask-once-then-apply** contract: the policy is captured once at the federation level and applied per sub-squad rather than re-asked. Names are scoped to a single roster, so two sub-squads may each carry an `Alpha` and the alias wordlist restarts per sub-squad. Promotion preserves the adopted squad's existing names and asks only for sub-squads it additionally creates; Expansion states the inherited policy and offers an override; an unattended Watch Mode bootstrap never asks (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md` *Naming in a Federation*).
  - The Squad Coordinator accepts an inherited `naming=<policy>` input and skips its own naming step when the federation already captured one, mirroring the existing `notify` inheritance (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
- **Init proposals named roles but not the agents behind them.** A profile-based proposal listed `researcher`, `lead`, `tester` and left the concrete cast invisible until after the write, so whether the user saw `Codebase Profiler` or nothing depended on how verbose the running model felt. Both coordinators now name each role's resolved Primary agent in the proposal, which is what the custom-roster menu already required (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).
- **The shipped Watch Mode workflow template had no model pin.** The live workflow in this repository pins `claude-sonnet-5`, but the template consumers copy invoked `copilot -p` with no `--model`, so every derived Watch Mode run fell back to `auto` — the precise condition the pin exists to prevent, in the one context where no human is watching for a coordinator that stopped dispatching. The template now carries the workflow-level `SQUAD_MODEL` env, a `workflow_dispatch` model override, and `--model "$RUN_MODEL"` on the CLI call (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/squad-watch.workflow.yml`).

### Changed

- **The orchestrator model pin is removed.** `0.11.0` added a `model:` preference list to `Squad Coordinator` and `Squad Federation Coordinator` to keep `auto` from routing the two most instruction-heavy agents to the cheapest option. It solved the wrong half of the problem: frontmatter is honored **only by the VS Code host**, so it never reached the unattended path it was meant to protect, while in the interactive host it overrode the consumer's own model selection on the one agent a person invokes by hand. That contradicts the cost-first tier routing the squad exists to provide — `Model Tier` in `team.md` and the consumption ledger both assume the operator controls spend — and an interactive turn has a human present to notice a degraded run. Both orchestrators now declare no `model:` preference and state why.
- **The model pin now lives only where nobody is watching.** Watch Mode passes `--model` to the Copilot CLI, which ignores agent frontmatter entirely, so the CI path is pinned by the repository owner rather than by the package. Per-role preference stays in the `Model Tier` column.

[0.11.1]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.11.1

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-28

> **Superseded — use 0.11.2 or later.** This release restored four of the five spine roles but repointed `researcher` at a delegated lane worker, so the Research stage produces no artifact and every downstream Artifact Gate is unsatisfiable. Fixed in 0.11.2.

### Fixed

- **The squad roster named agents hve-core no longer ships, so the methodology spine silently stopped dispatching.** Upstream consolidated Research, Plan, Implement, Review, and documentation from agents into skills. The cast catalog kept naming `Task Researcher`, `Task Planner`, `Task Implementor`, `Task Reviewer`, `Task Challenger`, `Phase Implementor`, `Researcher Subagent`, `Doc Ops`, `Code Review Full`, `PR Review`, `Plan Validator`, `RPI Validator`, `Implementation Validator`, `Arch Diagram Builder`, `Prompt Builder`, `Documentation Update Checker`, and `Memory` — none of which resolve. A dispatch against a missing agent returns nothing, and a coordinator that receives nothing tends to fill the gap by authoring the deliverable inline: no per-role history, no consumption ledger, no intake gate, and no council. The cast catalog is now rebuilt against the agents hve-core actually deploys (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).
- **A roster Primary could be an agent that `runSubagent` can never reach.** hve-core marks its user-invocable entry points `disable-model-invocation: true`, which makes them unreachable from a dispatch. Four roles pointed at one — most consequentially `presenter → PowerPoint Builder`, which is why deck builds fell back to improvised scripts instead of the `powerpoint` skill. A new **Dispatchability** rule forbids naming such an agent as a Primary or Alternate, and `presenter` now resolves to `PowerPoint Subagent` (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).
- **Deliverable paths were undefined for a federation.** The autopilot Artifact Gates named repository-root tracking paths while federation parameterized only *squad state*, so a sub-squad's BRD, plan, and deck had no defined home and landed inconsistently. A new **Deliverable Roots** table binds each role to a directory, adds a `Deliverable Root` column to `team.md`, and states the sub-squad rebasing rule explicitly; `docs/` alone stays repository-rooted (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`).
- **Verification was self-attested, so a run could report paths it never read.** Step 7 in both coordinators now requires enumerating directories and forbids quoting a path the turn did not read; the federation checklist calls out its two specific failure shapes — a cited deliverable path that does not exist, and a `members/<name>/history/` thinner than the roles the inner run claims to have dispatched (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).

### Added

- **Four squad-owned thin charters** restoring the roles whose hve-core agents became skills. Each is a dispatchable `user-invocable: false` shell that runs the corresponding skill and adds no method of its own: `Squad Lead` (`rpi-plan`, and it enumerates the run's deliverables and owning roles for fan-out), `Squad Implementor` (`rpi-implement`), `Squad Reviewer` (`rpi-review` and `code-review`), and `Squad Technical Writer` (`documentation`) — all under `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/`.
- **A roster-resolution precheck (Step 1b) before any dispatch.** The coordinator confirms every role in `team.md` resolves to an agent that is both installed and dispatchable, and stops with the failing list and three concrete corrections rather than working around it. This converts a silent dispatch failure into a visible one at the start of the turn (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
- **Model pinning on both orchestrators.** `Squad Coordinator` and `Squad Federation Coordinator` now declare a `model:` preference list (Claude Sonnet 5 → GPT-5.6 Terra → Claude Haiku 4.5), so an auto-selected model cannot route the two most instruction-heavy agents in the system to the cheapest option.
- **`scripts/Get-HveCoreCastDelta.ps1`** — compares the deployable agent cast between two hve-core refs and reports agents added, removed, and whose dispatchability flipped, cross-checked against `squad-src/` to mark a delta **BREAKING** when the squad still references a name. Emits a markdown adaptation brief, JSON, and workflow outputs.
- **An issue-driven upgrade loop, with no cron running a squad.** When the daily sync finds a breaking cast delta it stops before `apm.yml` and opens a `squad/auto` labeled issue whose body *is* the adaptation brief — what changed and why it breaks, eight numbered steps, editing constraints, acceptance criteria, and the generated delta table. One open issue per target SHA, so a repeat cron on an unresolved delta comments instead of duplicating. The label is the Watch Mode trigger, so the squad's task description is a durable, reviewable artifact rather than a string buried in a workflow.
- **`.github/workflows/squad-watch.yml`** — the live Watch Mode workflow, derived from the shipped reference template and scoped to two triggers: an issue labeled `squad/auto` runs autopilot in sub-squad `issue-<N>` and opens a draft PR that closes the issue; a pull request labeled `squad/review` runs the tester role in sub-squad `pr-<N>` and posts review findings. A `workflow_dispatch` input exists for testing the loop by hand. No schedule trigger — the only cron in the repository is the mechanical sync.
- **Unattended Gate Disposition** in `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md` — the contract for how Human Gates resolve when nobody is attached to a run. Stage transitions proceed on artifact evidence; final-outcome validation is satisfied by the draft pull request rather than a wait that can never end; Risk-Gate findings are recorded in `decisions.md` and reproduced in the PR body instead of blocking. The **Impactful-Action Gate never proceeds** — no exception, no payload override — and is enforced three independent ways: the contract, the absence of any deployment credential on the runner, and branch protection on the default branch.
- **Deck-pipeline guardrails.** `pptx-brand-template.instructions.md` now states that the `powerpoint` skill pipeline is the only supported path, forbids hand-rolled deck builders, and requires naming the missing prerequisite (`uv`, Python 3.11+, PowerShell 7+, LibreOffice) and returning the blocked step instead of improvising. Its `applyTo` also covers federation sub-squad deck paths.
- **A repository-scoped model pin for headless runs.** `squad-watch.yml` passes `--model` to the Copilot CLI from a workflow-level `SQUAD_MODEL` variable, with a `workflow_dispatch` input to override it for a single run. CLI precedence is `--model` over `COPILOT_MODEL` over `~/.copilot/settings.json`, and only the flag lives in the repository — so this is the one lever that pins a model for this project without changing anything user-wide or machine-wide. Agent `model:` frontmatter is honored by the VS Code host; it is not a substitute for the flag on the CI path.

### Changed

- **`sync-hve-core.yml` no longer bumps a breaking upgrade — it delegates one.** The mechanical path (move the SHA, bump the patch, write the CHANGELOG, release) is unchanged when the agent cast is stable. When the cast delta is breaking, the workflow stops before `apm.yml` and raises the labeled issue instead. A SHA move cannot repoint a roster row; this is the specific regression that shipped in `0.10.11`.
- `product-owner` resolves to `GitHub Backlog Manager`; ADO and Jira backlog managers are user-invocable only, so their tracker writes are planned by the squad and handed to the user to run.
- `Researcher Subagent` references across the Squad Cost Manager, IaC Author, Azure Diagnose, Modernization Planner, and the MCP capability map now point at `RPI Researcher`.
- The default routing table uses role names for the spine instead of agent names, so a future rename cannot break routing (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`).

### Upgrade notes

Existing squad state seeded by an earlier release still holds the old roster. After upgrading, re-seed so `team.md` picks up the corrected cast:

- **Single squad** — delete `.copilot-tracking/squad/team.md` and `routing.md`, then run `/squad`; Init reseeds them from the new catalog. Append-only logs are untouched.
- **Federation** — do the same inside each `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`.
- Verify the spine reads `RPI Researcher`, `Squad Lead`, `Squad Implementor`, `Squad Reviewer`, and that `presenter` reads `PowerPoint Subagent`.

For decks, install the skill's prerequisites (`uv`, Python 3.11+, PowerShell 7+, LibreOffice) and save a branded template at `.github/brand/pptx-brand-template.pptx`.

> **Do not use.** The squad methodology spine does not dispatch: the cast catalog names hve-core agents that no longer ship, so research, planning, implementation, and review silently produce nothing and the coordinator authors deliverables inline. Upgrade to 0.11.2 or later.

### Fixed

- **The approval-channel question is no longer skippable during a federation build.** Federation Init seeded `notify` with the `in-chat` default without ever asking the user, because the capture existed only as a sub-clause inside the *create* phase ("capture the optional approval channel") rather than as a gated question, and the detailed contract lives in an instruction file whose `applyTo` (`**/.copilot-tracking/squad/**`) does not match a repository that has no squad state yet. The question is now **required with an optional answer**: declining is a decision the user makes, not a step the coordinator may compress away.
  - The capture is promoted to a numbered **Federation Init Phase 1 step 5** with the choices inlined and an explicit wait-for-the-user gate, mirroring the single-squad treatment; Phase 2 now passes the captured object down instead of re-asking per sub-squad (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - New **ask-once-then-inherit** contract for federations: the channel is captured once at the federation root, seeded into the federation `state.json` `notify` object, and inherited by every `members/<name>/state.json`. Promotion reuses the existing squad's `notify` and confirms it back; Expansion inherits and offers a one-line override; a per-sub-squad override wins over the federation default at send time (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md`).
  - New **Unattended Runs** rule: a Watch Mode bootstrap has no user to ask, so it inherits the federation `notify` silently and falls back to `in-chat` rather than inventing a channel or blocking (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - The Squad Coordinator gains an inherited `notify=<object>` input and its Init step 5 is restated as required-not-skippable, with the inherited object as the single exception (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - The Squad Scribe's init, promotion, and expansion payloads now carry the `notify` object explicitly, and promotion seeds it into the federation `state.json` (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`).
  - Operator-view wording aligned in the squad skill (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

### Added

- **Event-scoped sub-squads for Watch Mode (continuous AI)** — every event-triggered run now executes inside a federation sub-squad dedicated to its triggering event, so what continuous AI did and why is auditable per issue, per pull request, per sweep, and per push. The Squad Federation Coordinator bootstraps whatever the repository is missing before the run starts: it initializes a federation on a bare project, **auto-promotes** an existing single squad into one (state relocated intact, append-only logs preserved byte-for-byte) and then adds the event's sub-squad, or **auto-expands** an existing federation. A re-triggered event reuses its sub-squad and resumes. Names are deterministic — `issue-<N>`, `pr-<N>`, `sweep-<YYYY-MM-DD>`, `push-<branch-slug>-<sha7>`, `dispatch-<runId>` — and are derived **only** from structural event metadata, never from issue, pull-request, or comment text, because a name becomes a filesystem path segment. The unattended promotion and expansion are auto-approved rather than confirmation-gated, bounded by writing only under `.copilot-tracking/squad/`, running only after the Watch Mode opt-in and trigger-authorization gates, and waiving no Human Gate inside the run.
  - New *Event-Scoped Sub-Squads (Federation Bootstrap)* contract replacing the old meta-routing sub-squad selection: bootstrap decision table, naming table with slug/length/fallback rules, metadata-only naming as an injection control, reuse-collision-concurrency rules, explicit-target override, profile precedence, provenance, retention, and escalation (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`).
  - New *Automatic Promotion (Watch Mode)*, *Automatic Expansion (Watch Mode)*, and *Watch-Owned Sub-Squads* sections; watch-created rows carry `Owner=watch-mode` and a narrow ref-keyed meta-routing pattern (`Parallel-Eligible: no`) so interactive requests never route into an event sub-squad — no registry schema change required (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md`).
  - The Squad Federation Coordinator gains **Watch Mode Bootstrap Mode** and a `watch=` provenance input; Step 1 branches to it and Step 2's classification is skipped for event turns (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - The Squad Scribe's promotion refusal is now documented as the **compare-and-swap** that makes concurrent bootstraps safe (the loser re-detects and continues as an expansion), and its expansion step records watch provenance, the `watch-mode` owner, and the ref-keyed route (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`).
  - The Squad Coordinator states that Watch Mode turns arrive with `squadRoot` already set to the event's sub-squad root and never run against the top-level root (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - The `/squad-federation` prompt gains the `watch` input (`squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad-federation.prompt.md`).
  - The reference trigger workflow derives the sub-squad name in its prepare step from structural metadata only, exposes it as a step output, and routes every event through `/squad-federation ... watch=...` (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/squad-watch.workflow.yml`).
- Documentation: an "Every run gets its own sub-squad" subsection in the Usage guide and an operator-view bullet in the squad skill (`docs/usage.html`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

## [0.10.8] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Add a sub-squad to an existing federation (Federation Expansion)** — a federation can now grow: once a `federation.md` exists, `/squad-federation init` (or an add-a-sub-squad request) runs **Federation Expansion Mode**, which proposes and, on confirmation, seeds a new sub-squad under `members/<new>/` and registers it — appending a row to `federation.md` and a route to `meta-routing.md` (preserve-on-replace, so existing sub-squads are untouched), plus a federation-level decision entry and `history/<new>.md`. The same `init` entry point now *builds* a federation on a fresh project and *expands* one that already exists, resolving the prior gap where adding a sub-squad was referenced but undefined. Additive, confirmation-gated, and non-destructive: it refuses on a name collision and never edits or removes an existing sub-squad.
  - New *Expansion: Add a Sub-Squad to an Existing Federation* contract with trigger, preserve-on-replace registration, and collision guards (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md`).
  - The Squad Federation Coordinator gains **Federation Expansion Mode**; Init Mode branches on federation existence (build vs expand), and the previously undefined "runs Federation Init to add a sub-squad" references now point at Expansion (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - The Squad Scribe gains an expansion payload and **Step 11** that read-merge-writes the registry and meta-routing (preserving existing rows), appends the decision, and creates `history/<new>.md` (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`).
  - The `/squad-federation` prompt clarifies that `init` builds a federation or adds a sub-squad to an existing one (`squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad-federation.prompt.md`).
- Documentation: an "Add a sub-squad to an existing federation" subsection in the Usage guide and an operator-view expansion bullet in the squad skill (`docs/usage.html`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

## [0.10.7] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Promote a single squad to a federation (opt-in)** — an existing single-squad project (a top-level `team.md`) can now be adopted into a federation as its first sub-squad without starting over. `/squad-federation promote` runs a confirmation-gated propose → confirm → migrate → seed → route flow: it relocates the whole top-level state tree (`team.md`, `routing.md`, `decisions.md`, `history/`, consumption, and the rest) into `members/<name>/` intact — append-only decision and history logs preserved byte-for-byte — then seeds the federation meta layer (`federation.md`, `meta-routing.md`, and a federation-level decisions/history trail). The move removes the top-level `team.md`, flipping detection to federation mode. It is additive and non-destructive: a relocation rather than a rebuild, refusing on a name collision or when a `federation.md` already exists, and a consumer who never promotes is unaffected.
  - New *Promotion: Single Squad → Federation* contract with trigger, Scribe-performed relocation and meta-seed steps, and idempotency/collision guards (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md`).
  - The Squad Federation Coordinator gains **Federation Promotion Mode** and a `promote` input, and its Step 1 detects an existing top-level `team.md` and routes to promotion instead of a from-scratch Init (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - The Squad Scribe gains a promotion payload and **Step 10** that relocates the top-level tree and seeds the federation-root meta layer as the single writer (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`).
  - The `/squad-federation` prompt adds the `promote` input, and the single Squad Coordinator (and `/squad` prompt) offer the `/squad-federation promote` handoff when a top-level `team.md` exists and the user asks to federate (`squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad-federation.prompt.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad.prompt.md`).

- **Auto-mode reliability hardening for the squad orchestrators** — restated the existing proof-of-dispatch and artifact-gate rules as mechanical, imperative checklists so lighter or auto-selected models follow them step-by-step instead of narrating skipped stages. Additive only: no new modes, gates, or human approvals, and no behavior change for frontier models.
  - Squad Coordinator gains a **Step 7: Verify Before Responding** turn-completion checklist and a **Fast-Tier Robustness** callout (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - Squad Federation Coordinator gains a two-level **Step 7** verification and a **Fast-Tier Robustness** callout (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`).
  - Autopilot adds a **Per-Stage Advance Checklist**; federation autopilot adds a **Meta-Stage Advance and Gate-Propagation Checklist** that requires an inner sub-squad gate to be surfaced and approved before the meta-pipeline advances (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md`).

## [0.10.3] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Requirements intake gate (conditional pre-work readiness check)** — before the squad plans, implements, or produces a deliverable on work grounded in requirement or input artifacts (a PRD, BRD, specification, user story, design document, transcript, or a user-referenced file), the coordinator now runs an intake gate that validates those inputs for completeness, clarity, testability, consistency, and scope boundaries, and records an `## Intake Readiness Verdict` (`Ready`, `Ready-With-Gaps`, or `Not-Ready`) in `decisions.md`. On `Not-Ready` it runs a bounded auto-remediation loop (dispatch `analyst`/`product-owner` to fill the blocking gaps, then re-validate; capped at two cycles) and escalates when a gap needs a human decision. The gate is conditional and additive: with no input artifacts in scope it is a silent no-op.
  - New `squad-intake-gate.instructions.md` conventions: trigger conditions, gate membership, readiness assessment, verdict synthesis, the auto-remediation loop, the Intake Readiness Verdict schema, the verdict anchor and reuse, and mode/federation interaction (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-intake-gate.instructions.md`).
  - New `intake-validator` role seeded into the `product` and `full` profiles (addable to any roster), reusing existing agents by input type — Product Manager Advisor (default), PRD Quality Reviewer, BRD Quality Reviewer, and Task Challenger (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).
  - Routing gains an Intake Gate section and an explicit `intake-validator` routing row; the gate runs ahead of the Implementation Gate and, in profiles without the role, escalates to add it rather than skipping the check (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`).
  - The Squad Coordinator runs the gate in its per-turn protocol and as autopilot stage 0; the Squad Federation Coordinator inherits it per sub-squad; the Squad Scribe writes the Intake Readiness Verdict (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`).
  - Autopilot adds a conditional intake stage (stage 0) with an artifact gate and a Risk Gate trigger for an unclearable `Not-Ready`; the state conventions record the intake stage in proof-of-dispatch; the squad skill documents the gate procedure and seed templates (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
  - Documented the intake gate on the usage page and the home page (`docs/usage.html`, `docs/index.html`).

## [0.10.2] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Federation-level autopilot (opt-in)** — `/squad-federation mode=autopilot` with no `squad=` target now runs a meta-pipeline that coordinates several sub-squads under one coherent set of Human Gates. It orders the selected sub-squads by dependency (confirmed at the first gate), runs each one's standard single-squad autopilot inner run scoped to `members/<name>/`, aggregates every Impactful-Action and Risk Gate to the federation level (attributed to the raising sub-squad, most-restrictive-wins), applies one aggregate `cost-ceiling`, and ends with a single consolidated final-outcome validation. It is opt-in and backward-compatible: a single `squad=` target keeps the forward-only behavior, single-squad autopilot is unchanged, and each sub-squad's inner pipeline is untouched.
  - New `squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md` conventions: the trigger and opt-in surface, the build precondition, the meta-pipeline contract, sub-squad execution ordering, federation Human Gates, the aggregate cost ceiling, and consolidated final-outcome validation (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation-autopilot.instructions.md`).
  - `Squad Federation Coordinator` gains a **Federation Autopilot Mode** section, and the `/squad-federation` prompt documents the meta-pipeline trigger (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad-federation.prompt.md`).
  - Two-level run provenance: the Squad Scribe writes a federation-root `history/autopilot-run-<id>.md` linking each sub-squad's inner run, and the federation `state.json` gains additive `mode` and `currentRun` fields (`schemaVersion` `1.0` → `1.1`) for the aggregate cost (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md`).
  - Watch Mode gains a federation-routing clause: a repository event is routed to a sub-squad via `meta-routing.md`, then that sub-squad's autopilot runs unchanged and produces a pull request (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md`).
  - Documented federation-wide autopilot on the usage page (`docs/usage.html`).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Squad federation (in-repo sub-squads)** — one repository can now host several named sub-squads side by side (for example, a `product` sub-squad for the business team and an `azure` sub-squad for the architects), each an ordinary squad rooted at `.copilot-tracking/squad/members/<name>/`. Federation is opt-in and additive: a repository that never opts in behaves exactly as before.
  - New `Squad Federation Coordinator` agent and `/squad-federation` prompt: builds a federation (propose → confirm → create), then routes each request to one or more sub-squads (or an explicit `squad=<name>` target) and runs each scoped to its own root (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-federation-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad-federation.prompt.md`).
  - New `squad-federation.instructions.md` conventions: the parameterized squad root (`squadRoot`), the federation state layout, detection precedence (`federation.md` → federation, else top-level `team.md` → plain squad, else Init), the `federation.md` registry and `meta-routing.md` schemas, required-unique sub-squad naming, and the two-level single-writer rule (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-federation.instructions.md`).
  - The Squad Coordinator gained an optional `squadRoot` input and a federation-aware Step 1, and its Init Mode now opens with a single-squad-or-federation choice on a fresh project; the Squad Scribe writes scoped to the resolved root and to the federation root; the squad skill documents the federation layer and ships federation seed templates (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`, `squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad.prompt.md`).
- Documentation: a Federation section in the Usage guide and a Federation feature card on the site home page (`docs/usage.html`, `docs/index.html`).

### Notes

- Multi-repo federation (a hub coordinating one squad per repository) and federation-level autopilot (a coordinated pipeline across sub-squads) are researched and planned but not shipped in this release; single-sub-squad autonomy modes work today via forwarding.

[0.9.1]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.9.1

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Watch Mode (DR-01)** — the event-driven "continuous AI" trigger contract that turns a new issue (or PR, comment, schedule, or manual dispatch) into a headless squad run that opens a draft pull request. New `.github/instructions/squad/squad-watch-mode.instructions.md` defines the opt-in gates, the event-to-intent map, injection-safe payload handling (issue text is data, never instructions), profile inference (falls back to `default` when the issue is ambiguous), the draft-PR deliverable, idempotency and resume, and escalation.
- Shipped the documentation-only reference workflow `.github/skills/squad/squad-watch.workflow.yml` that runs the squad headlessly via the GitHub Copilot CLI (`copilot -p`). It wires the full event-to-intent map in one file — labeled issues, `squad/review` pull requests, `/squad` comment commands, a scheduled maintenance sweep, `workflow_dispatch`, and branch-filtered pushes — each authorized to write collaborators, fork-safe (never `pull_request_target`), with the event payload passed as data. Copy it to `.github/workflows/squad-watch.yml` to activate.
- Documented Watch Mode setup and its end-to-end flow (with a Mermaid diagram) on the Usage page.

### Changed

- Bumped `state.json` `schemaVersion` to `1.2` with an optional, backward-compatible `trigger` object recording event provenance (`source`, `ref`, `eventId`, `actor`, `receivedAt`, `runId`). Existing state stays valid; runs that were not event-triggered omit it.
- Wired the Watch Mode contract into the squad `SKILL.md` overview and the Squad Coordinator's governing conventions; the previously deferred DR-01 note in `squad-state.instructions.md` is now the active Watch Mode contract.
- Updated hve-core dependency pin to `21148ef` (21148ef1b62010e17a3d57f62f554cad340bda99).

## [0.8.22] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Rewrote the `sql-migration-advisor` skill to align with the upstream interview-first playbook: source-of-truth fetch posture, core principles, ~11-question guided interview with answer lists, deterministic Step A–D scoring, clean-Markdown recommendation card, and guardrails (adapted from `fredgis/sql-migration-advisor`, MIT, with attribution retained).
- Updated `Squad SQL Migration Advisor` to load the skill and enforce a strict one-question-at-a-time interview using the skill's answer lists, withholding the recommendation card until the interview completes and tying scoring to the skill's Step A–D decision rules.

### Added

- Bundled `reference/decision-rules.md` as an offline fallback for the `sql-migration-advisor` skill so deterministic scoring works without network access.

[0.8.22]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.8.22

## [0.8.21] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Added `Squad SQL Migration Advisor` as a dedicated advisory subagent for SQL Server-to-Azure migration planning, including schema/data migration path selection and downtime-aware cutover guidance.
- Added the `sql-migration-advisor` skill and wired SQL migration cues so modernization requests can deterministically route to the SQL advisory path.

### Changed

- Extended the `modernizer` role mapping with `Squad SQL Migration Advisor` as an alternate, and added `modernizer` to the `azure` profile roster.
- Updated squad coordinator dispatch allowlist and routing rules to recognize SQL migration keywords and send those requests through `modernizer` in confirm-mode.

## [0.8.19] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Decision Ref** deep links on council and autopilot gates. Every Council Verdict entry in `decisions.md` is now addressable by a stable Markdown-heading anchor (for example `.copilot-tracking/squad/decisions.md#council-verdict-<timestamp>-<topic-id>`), and the coordinator surfaces that reference whenever it reports a verdict or opens a gate. The Scribe returns the anchor in its verdict-write confirmation, and the notification payload carries a `Decision Ref` line so a human can jump straight to the exact section of the append-only file instead of scanning for it. See `squad-council.instructions.md`, `squad-notifications.instructions.md`, `squad-autopilot.instructions.md`, `squad-scribe.agent.md`, and `squad-coordinator.agent.md`.
- Consumer docs: a "Finding the details behind a gate" section in `docs/usage.html` with a rendered Mermaid diagram showing where each gate records its details (`decisions.md`, `state.json`/history, `notifications.md`).

## [0.8.18] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Companion **hve-squad-mcp** server repository — a deployable Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that publishes the squad as model-invocable tools (`squad_research`, `squad_plan`, `squad_review`, `squad_architect`, `squad_run`) plus a deterministic `squad_render_pptx` file-output tool, over Streamable HTTP with Entra auth for hosts such as Copilot Studio. See [github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad-mcp](https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad-mcp).

### Changed

- Coordinating version bump that establishes the link between this package version and the companion `hve-squad-mcp` release: the MCP server pins its bundled squad cast to `hve-squad@0.8.18` (`host/cast/package-pin.json`). The hve-core dependency pin is unchanged (`c5de202`).

- Squad consumption ledger is now always populated. Bound the per-dispatch consumption block to the Proof-of-Dispatch gate, made the Squad Scribe self-derive a tier-default estimate when no consumption payload is supplied, hardened coordinator dispatch discipline to always pass an attribution, and added seed reconciliation so a disrupted run backfills `consumption.md` on the next turn.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-06-26

Makes squad setup self-service when no built-in profile fits. At first run the coordinator now asks you to proceed with the proposed profile or choose differently; decline and you can pick another profile or build a custom roster from a described menu of every available role — so you always pick from real, deployed agents and never invent one. This release also fans out the autopilot Implement stage across owning specialists for multi-deliverable (`product`) profiles.

### Added

- **Custom roster selection at first run** — a new "Building a Custom Roster" role menu (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`) lists every selectable role with a plain-language description and the deployed agent that fills it, and the Squad Coordinator's Init Mode offers it whenever you decline the proposed profile (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, mirrored in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`). A custom roster always keeps `scribe`, recommends the methodology spine, flags any role whose agent is not installed, and never invents a role or agent outside the cast catalog.
- **Autopilot deliverable fan-out** (#33) — for profiles that carry two or more deliverable-producing roles (the `product` profile), the autopilot Implement stage now enumerates the requested deliverables and dispatches each owning specialist instead of a single `developer`; spine-shaped profiles keep the unchanged single-developer build (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

### Changed

- Init Mode's "propose" step is now an explicit **proceed-or-decline** decision: proceeding keeps the existing flow, while declining leads to either a different profile (each shown with its one-line description) or a custom roster. Adjusting a profile is recorded as a custom roster derived from it, since any change to a profile's exact member set makes it custom (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).
- Documented the first-run custom-roster option on the Usage page (`docs/usage.html`).

## [0.8.8] - 2026-06-25

Adds automatic PowerPoint branding so generated decks follow your own template without any manual setup. A new shipped instruction makes the PowerPoint Builder use your branded `.pptx` for every deck, and when no template is present it asks for one and offers to save it — so a non-technical user never copies a file, edits a config, or restates the template on each request.

### Added

- Brand-template instruction (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/pptx-brand-template.instructions.md`), shipped as package content that auto-applies on install: the PowerPoint Builder uses the project's branded template at `.github/brand/pptx-brand-template.pptx` as `--template` for full rebuilds and `--source` for partial rebuilds, and when the template is missing it asks the user and offers to save the one they provide rather than producing a plain deck.
- "Bring your own PowerPoint template" docs page (`docs/ppt-templates.html`), wired into the docs navigation across the site, covering template preparation, the storage convention, the automatic behavior, and the validation loop.

### Changed

- Registered the brand-template instruction in `apm.yml` so it deploys to every consumer on install.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-06-23

Adds cross-consumer self-learning: a durable learning discovered in one consumer can be sanitized, reviewed, and shipped as versioned package content that every consumer receives on the next sync, with a parallel tenant-internal path for learnings that must stay inside one organization. A new `/squad-learn` command drafts a sanitized candidate from local squad memory and opens the promotion pull request.

### Added

- `/squad-learn` command (`squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad-learn.prompt.md`): discovers candidate learnings from consumer-local memory, sanitizes them, lets you choose the `upstream` (cross-consumer) or `tenant` (organization-internal) target, and opens the promotion pull request behind an explicit impactful-action gate.
- Curated shared-learnings playbook (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/learnings/shared-learnings.md`), shipped as versioned package content that the coordinator reads as read-only, authoritative context after consumer-local memory.
- Contribution governance: `CONTRIBUTING.md` with the learnings-promotion process and sanitization checklist, plus the sanitization checklist added to `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- Tenant-internal C1 scaffold (`docs/templates/tenant-squad-learnings/`): a copyable private-repository template using a separate `squad-learnings-tenant` skill folder that deploys to a non-colliding path, with the `docs/templates/shared-learnings.md` reference describing both promotion options.
- Contributing site page (`docs/contributing.html`) wired into the docs navigation across the site.

### Changed

- The squad operating procedure now consults the shipped shared-learnings playbook and the optional tenant playbook as read-only context (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`).
- The Squad Scribe may surface a sanitized promotion candidate and point to the `/squad-learn` command and the `CONTRIBUTING.md` promotion paths, while still never writing outside consumer-local memory (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`).
- Documented the `/squad-learn` command on the Usage page (`docs/usage.html`).

## [0.8.6] - 2026-06-22

Adds a `product` squad profile and a non-technical Product Squad demo, so the squad can run business discovery and delivery — requirements, design thinking, roadmap, validation, and stakeholder deliverables — through the same Research → Plan → Implement → Review methodology, not just technical work.

### Added

- `product` squad profile (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, mirrored in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md` and `docs/usage.html`): seeds the methodology spine plus `analyst`, `designer`, `product-owner`, `presenter`, `technical-writer`, and `experimenter`, with a Profile Selection discovery signal for requirements/roadmap/discovery repositories.
- Business routing rows (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`) mapping requirements/BRD/PRD, journey-map/design-thinking, roadmap/backlog, experiment/MVE, presentation/deck, and document intents to the PRD Builder, DT Coach, Agile Coach, Experiment Designer, PowerPoint Builder, and Doc Ops agents.
- Demo 2 — Product Squad (`docs/demo-2.html`): a non-technical, no-cloud/no-spend walkthrough (discovery → BRD → roadmap and backlog → validation experiment → readiness review → executive deck) plus a say-it-once `mode=autopilot` version, wired into the demo chevron selector.

### Changed

- The Squad Coordinator dispatch allowlist now includes the product-profile business agents (PRD Builder, BRD Builder, Meeting Analyst, Product Manager Advisor, DT Coach, Agile Coach, GitHub Backlog Manager, Experiment Designer, PowerPoint Builder, PowerPoint Subagent, Doc Ops), and `product` is added to the `profile=` enumerations (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad.prompt.md`).
- The home page demo card now points to both the Azure and the Product squad walkthroughs (`docs/index.html`).

## [0.8.5] - 2026-06-22

Adds per-run consumption tracking so a squad run estimates its model cost and AI-credit usage, and hardens the Azure-icon diagram path with copy-don't-reauthor and verified-node-class guardrails.

### Added

- Consumption tracking across the squad. The Squad Scribe gains a Write Consumption step that records a per-dispatch consumption block in `history/<agent>.md` (append-only), rewrites the aggregated `consumption.md` member/model/credit ledger with a manual-baseline cost-comparison line, and updates the new `state.json` `currentRun` totals (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
- `consumption-rates.md`, a single maintainable per-model token-rate table (USD per 1M tokens) plus the comparison methodology, seeded from a template on first run and isolating volatile pricing from agent logic (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
- Azure-icon diagram render troubleshooting on the docs site (`docs/troubleshooting.html`): the Microsoft Store `python` stub, Graphviz off PATH, the `uv run --with diagrams` path, and the `verify_installation.py` check.

### Changed

- Updated hve-core dependency pin to `b69e34a` (b69e34ac38b39bd3b20bf80fa142c8ca3a3b29ed).
- The Squad Coordinator now records the dispatched model (or its tier when unknown) and an estimated-token consumption payload through the Scribe, keeping cost-first model selection visible in the ledger (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
- The roster clarifies that `Model Tier` records a preference, not the model that actually ran; the concrete model is captured per dispatch in the consumption block (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).
- The Squad Azure Architect and the `python-diagrams` skill now require copying the bundled `diagram_io.py` and a `templates/` generator verbatim, verifying every `diagrams.azure.*` node class exists before use, and modeling external actors as real nodes rather than bare strings (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-azure-architect.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/python-diagrams/SKILL.md`).

## [0.8.4] - 2026-06-19

Adds a Python `diagrams` skill for committed Azure-icon architecture diagrams and a docs Demo page, and removes third-party accelerator references.

### Added

- `python-diagrams` skill (`squad-src/.github/skills/python-diagrams/`): renders committed Azure-icon HLD/LLD diagrams with the Python `diagrams` library on a Graphviz backend, emitting paired PNG + SVG via a shared `diagram_io` output helper. Ships an `azure-webapp-lld` template, a `requirements.txt`, and a `verify_installation.py` check, and is registered in `apm.yml` dependencies.
- Docs Demo page (`docs/demo.html`) with a multi-demo chevron selector and a `Demo` entry added to the navigation across the docs site. Includes an Optional Azure-icon architecture diagrams section documenting the `uv` + Graphviz prerequisite and the one-clause `/squad` trigger.

### Changed

- Squad Azure Architect (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-azure-architect.agent.md`): the diagram-rendering step now follows a three-tier ladder — draw.io MCP when configured, the `python-diagrams` skill for a committed icon image, then Mermaid as the always-available fallback.
- Demo doc `/squad` requests updated to the real tested workload (frontend + backend web apps, VNet/subnets, private endpoints, under $60, containerization left to the squad) for the autopilot one-request version and the Beat 1 (cost) and Beat 2 (architecture) examples.

### Removed

- All references to the third-party APEX accelerator across the changelog, the MCP reference template (`mcp.template.json`), the capability map (`squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`), and the `azure-scaffold` skill.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-18

Fork-specific release. No functional changes to squad content relative to upstream `Peter-N91/hve-squad@v0.8.1`.

### Changed

- Automated sync workflow (`sync-hve-core.yml`): all `microsoft/hve-core` content is now referenced directly from `microsoft/hve-core` at a pinned commit SHA. On each run the workflow fetches the latest `microsoft/hve-core` commit, regenerates `apm.yml` deps, bumps the patch version, updates this changelog, commits, and dispatches `release.yml`.
- Sync and release responsibilities split: `sync-hve-core.yml` owns the apm.yml bump and commit; `release.yml` only tags the version currently on `main` and publishes the GitHub Release (with an optional `version` input for manual bumps). Squad self-references stay pinned to upstream `Peter-N91/hve-squad` (the script default) so a fork's automation never rewrites them to its own slug.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-17

Guarantees the HVE Core delivery methodology — Research → Plan → Implement → Review — runs in every squad profile, not just the general-purpose ones. Adds a universal methodology spine to all profiles and a post-implementation review step, and lets the Squad Coordinator dispatch the three Azure-track roles that `0.8.0` shipped but left out of the coordinator's dispatch allowlist.

### Fixed

- The Squad Coordinator can now dispatch `Squad As-Built Author`, `Squad Azure Diagnose`, and `Squad Modernization Planner` (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`). `0.8.0` deployed these agent files and registered them in the roster, but the coordinator's `agents:` allowlist omitted them, so the as-built, diagnose, and modernization beats could not run.
- Specialized profiles no longer skip legs of the methodology. The `security`, `design`, `architecture`, and `azure` profiles previously omitted one or more of `researcher`, `lead`, `developer`, and `tester`, so the routing Implementation Gate escalated (a required role was absent from the roster) instead of running Research → Plan → Implement. Every profile now carries the full spine (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, mirrored in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

### Added

- Methodology spine in the roster and skill: `researcher`, `lead`, `developer`, and `tester` are now always-included members of every profile (alongside `scribe`), documented as the four roles that run Research → Plan → Implement → Review (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
- A `Review Follow-Through` rule in the routing conventions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`): after any implementation-tier role lands a change, the coordinator dispatches `tester` (review) as the closing stage in every mode, making the gate symmetric — research and plan precede implementation, review follows it.

### Changed

- `docs/usage.html` Profiles table updated so every profile lists its methodology-spine members, with a note that every profile runs Research → Plan → Implement → Review.
- `apm.yml` package version bumped to `0.8.1`. The dependency entries are unchanged from `0.8.0` (the edited squad files keep the same paths), so the pinned hve-core commit from `0.7.0`/`0.8.0` is preserved.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-17

Adds live Azure governance discovery, post-deployment as-built documentation, and resource-level triage and diagnosis to the Azure squad: all delivered as two new read-only squad roles backed by the official `@azure/mcp` server, with named non-MCP fallbacks so a missing server never blocks the squad.

### Added

- `Squad As-Built Author` agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-asbuilt-author.agent.md`): a read-only post-deploy role that inventories deployed Azure resources via the `azure-resource` capability (`@azure/mcp` Resource Graph KQL preferred, `az` CLI / Resource Manager REST fallback), builds a compliance matrix from Azure Policy state, and drafts an operations runbook and backup/DR plan for Doc Ops to publish. Never deploys, mutates resources, or authors IaC.
- `Squad Azure Diagnose` agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-azure-diagnose.agent.md`): a strictly read-only Azure troubleshooting role that queries Resource Health, Azure Monitor/Log Analytics KQL, and Resource Graph to correlate ranked hypotheses and recommend (never apply) remediations. Defers every change to the gated Squad Deployer or Squad IaC Author.
- `azure-resource` MCP capability row in the capability map (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`): maps the new `azure-resource` capability to `@azure/mcp` with a named `az` CLI / Resource Graph REST fallback, following the existing graceful-degradation contract.
- Official `@azure/mcp` server wired into the MCP reference template (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`): stdio entry invoking `@azure/mcp@latest server start`, authenticated via `DefaultAzureCredential` / `az login` with no stored secrets. A community Azure pricing MCP recommendation replaces the prior placeholder (primary: `msftnadavbh/AzurePricingMCP`), with a labeled WI-02 placeholder for the unverified exact stdio invocation.
- Read-only Azure Policy precheck on the Squad Deployer (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-deployer.agent.md`): a new step between the what-if/plan dry-run and the Impactful-Action Gate that queries effective Azure Policy assignments and compliance for the target scope, surfacing predicted denials before approval. The gate semantics, `confirm` tier, and Mandatory Escalation Triggers are unchanged.
- `.vscode/mcp.json` entry in the azure-scaffold bundled templates and opt-in scaffolding flow (`squad-src/.github/skills/azure-scaffold/SKILL.md`): consumers can merge the squad MCP template into their workspace on request; the turnkey-via-scaffolding posture is documented in the skill overview. The APM package itself never writes consumer `.vscode/` or `.devcontainer/` trees.
- Roster, routing, and profile wiring for both new roles (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, `squad-routing.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`): `asbuilt-author` at `confirm` tier (non-parallel), `azure-diagnose` at `auto` tier (parallel-eligible); both registered in the `azure` and `full` squad profiles. Pre-existing SKILL-vs-roster profile mirror drift for `iac-author`, `deployer`, and `modernizer` reconciled in the same edit.

### Changed

- `apm.yml` dependency list updated: two new squad agent files added (`squad-asbuilt-author.agent.md`, `squad-azure-diagnose.agent.md`) and the package version bumped to `0.8.0`.

### Consumer install

Pin to this version:

```powershell

```

[0.8.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.8.0

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-16

Makes installs reproducible by pinning every dependency to an immutable ref, so a published version keeps resolving the same files even after `microsoft/hve-core` changes its default branch. This fixes transitive installs of `0.6.0`, which broke when hve-core consolidated several instruction files on `main`.

### Fixed

- Transitive installs no longer break on hve-core drift. Previously the `dependencies.apm` entries for `microsoft/hve-core` were unpinned (bare paths), so any consumer re-resolved them against hve-core's moving `main`; once hve-core consolidated 13 instruction files, those paths 404'd and the install failed. Every hve-core entry is now pinned to a commit SHA, and the squad self-references are pinned to the release tag.

### Changed

- `scripts/Update-ApmDependencies.ps1` now pins generated dependencies: each `microsoft/hve-core` entry is suffixed with `#<commit-sha>` (the `-Ref` value resolved to a concrete commit), and a new optional `-SquadRef` parameter pins the `Peter-N91/hve-squad` self-references with `#<ref>` (use the release tag you are cutting). Repository discovery switched from `git clone --branch` to `git init` + `git fetch` so `-Ref` can be a branch, tag, or commit SHA.
- `apm.yml` dependency list regenerated against hve-core `main` (commit `a847cfa3b82d7c09d707d5e3d978780ad1d599d3`), with squad self-references pinned to `v0.7.0`, and the package version bumped to `0.7.0`.

apm install "Peter-N91/hve-squad#v0.7.0"
```

[0.7.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.7.0

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-15

Adds a modernization capability to the squad: a single `modernizer` role, reachable from the one `/squad` entry point, that plans same-stack framework and dependency upgrades and cross-stack re-platforms (for example, Node.js to .NET or React to Angular), then routes execution to the squad developer role or Microsoft's official App Modernization tooling.

### Added

- Squad Modernization Planner agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-modernization-planner.agent.md`): a markdown-only planning charter that classifies the modernization request, delegates current-state code scans to the Researcher Subagent, defines a target state and a phased plan, and recommends the execution engine — the `developer` role for scoped edits or the official GitHub Copilot App Modernization extension and CLI for large batch upgrades. It plans only; it never edits source and never deploys.
- Cross-stack re-platform mode in the same charter: a self-contained mode for rewrites across languages or frameworks that captures a behavior contract for the current system, sequences an incremental (strangler-fig) rewrite, routes execution to the `developer` and `architect` roles under mandatory council review, and never recommends the official upgrade tooling (which upgrades within a stack and cannot perform a cross-stack rewrite). The same-stack modes are unchanged.
- `modernizer` role in the roster cast catalog and the `full` profile (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, mirrored in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`), plus same-stack and re-platform routing rows (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`).
- Documentation: a Modernization card on the home page and a Modernization section in Usage (`docs/index.html`, `docs/usage.html`).

### Changed

- Squad Coordinator dependency registration: `apm.yml` registers the new Squad Modernization Planner agent, and `apm.lock.yaml` was refreshed.
- README and home-page install pins bumped from `v0.5.0` to `v0.6.0` (`README.md`, `docs/index.html`), and the package version in `apm.yml` bumped to `0.6.0`.

### Consumer install

```powershell
apm install "Peter-N91/hve-squad#v0.6.0"
```

[0.6.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.6.0

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-15

Adds an Azure execution layer so any repo that installs hve-squad can author IaC, deploy to Azure, and govern infrastructure the package way — through documentation-only reference templates plus two new squad agents — and hardens the squad methodology so the coordinator always dispatches the mapped HVE Core agents and builds the squad before doing work.

### Added

- `azure-scaffold` skill (`squad-src/.github/skills/azure-scaffold/`): documentation-only reference templates a consumer-facing agent scaffolds into a consumer repo — a dev container (Azure CLI + Bicep, Terraform + TFLint, `gh`, Node, Python), `azure/login@v2` OIDC deploy workflows for Bicep and Terraform, a `Setup-AzureOidc.ps1` wizard (Entra app registration, OIDC federated credentials, RBAC, GitHub secrets), a read-only `Get-PolicyBaseline.ps1` plus a scheduled governance-baseline workflow, and the `infra/bicep/{project}` / `infra/terraform/{project}` convention. Nothing runs from the package; activation is an explicit copy-and-commit, and authentication is OIDC (no stored secrets).
- Squad IaC Author agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-iac-author.agent.md`): converts the Squad Azure Architect's LLD table into Bicep or Terraform under `infra/{track}/{project}` with AVM modules, scaffolds the `azure-scaffold` templates, validates statically, and hands off to cost and deploy — never deploys.
- Squad Deployer agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-deployer.agent.md`): runs Azure deployments in the consumer's environment, defaulting to a read-only `what-if`/`plan` and gating every `create`/`apply` behind the Impactful-Action Gate.
- Optional `azure-pricing` MCP entry in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`, with the anonymous Azure Retail Prices REST fallback documented for the Squad Cost Manager.
- `azure` squad profile and the `iac-author` and `deployer` roles in the roster cast catalog (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`), plus IaC-authoring and deployment routing rows (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`).
- Documentation: an Azure execution layer card on the home page and an Azure execution layer / scaffolding-flow section in Usage and Getting Started (`docs/index.html`, `docs/usage.html`, `docs/getting-started.html`).

### Changed

- Methodology enforcement (the coordinator must use the mapped HVE Core agents): added a non-negotiable Dispatch Discipline section to the Squad Coordinator (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`) forbidding inline work, artifact-gate preconditions to the routing Implementation Gate (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`) and the autopilot pipeline (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`), a hard council-quorum stop (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-council.instructions.md`), a no-self-fill rule for absent roles (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`), and a proof-of-dispatch rule keyed to `history/<agent>.md` (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`).
- Autopilot now treats Init Mode (building and confirming the squad) as a precondition it never skips, in both the Squad Coordinator and the autopilot Pipeline Contract.
- Squad Coordinator `agents:` frontmatter registers the new Squad IaC Author and Squad Deployer agents, and `apm.yml` registers both agents and the `azure-scaffold` skill.

[0.5.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.5.0

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-12

Adds a GitHub Pages documentation site so consumers and maintainers get a navigable how-to reference instead of one large README, and trims the README to a short landing page that links to it.

### Added

- Documentation site under `docs/`: a custom static site (landing page plus Getting Started, Usage, Maintaining, and Troubleshooting pages) with a shared dark theme in `docs/assets/style.css` and a `docs/.nojekyll` marker.
- GitHub Pages deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`): publishes `docs/` via GitHub Actions on every push to `main` that touches `docs/`, with SHA-pinned actions, least-privilege permissions, and `persist-credentials: false`.

### Changed

- README trimmed to a short landing page that links to the documentation site and retains quick start, repository structure, and versioning.

[0.4.1]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.4.1

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-12

Adds two new autonomy modes — a full `mode=autopilot` pipeline and a remote, phone-approvable notification channel — so the squad can run unattended (for example, a multi-hour job on a VM) and stop for a human only at impactful actions and final-outcome validation.

### Added

- Autopilot mode instructions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`): opt-in `mode=autopilot` that sequences research → plan → council → implement → review → final-outcome validation end-to-end, with two narrow Human Gates (Impactful-Action and Risk) and a no-auto-release rule.
- Notification + remote-approval instructions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`): build-time approval-channel capture, three adapters (`github-issue`, `webhook`, `in-chat`), the GitHub-issue approval protocol (`/approve`, `/approve-all`, `/changes:`, `/stop`), authorization and prompt-injection guards, and the append-only `notifications.md` log.
- GitHub approval-watcher reference workflow (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/github-approval-watcher.workflow.yml`): documentation-only `issue_comment`/label watcher that relays an authorized human decision so an unattended run resumes; performs no impactful action itself.
- `github-issue` row in the MCP capability map (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`) with the `github` MCP → `gh` CLI → in-chat fallback chain, and an optional `github` server entry in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`.
- README: Autonomy modes table, remote approval (unattended/VM) guidance, and a one-time remote-approval setup section.

### Changed

- Squad Coordinator (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`): Init Mode now captures an optional approval channel (defaulting to `in-chat` so local, at-the-PC runs are unaffected) and the agent gained Autopilot Mode orchestration plus the new `mode` input.
- Squad prompt (`squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad.prompt.md`): `mode` input accepts `autonomous|autopilot` and routes to the matching contract.
- Squad state conventions and `state.json` seed (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`): added the `notify` object (`approvalChannel`, `enabled`, `email`, `github`), the `mode` field, the `notifications.md` and `autopilot-run-<id>.md` files, and the `squad_notify` verb.

```

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.4.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-11

Adds capability-aware MCP routing for dispatched squad roles, a reference Azure DevOps MCP template, two new specialist agents, a model-pin convention for mechanical roles, and the DD-07 source-tree recovery that lets `apm install` resolve the squad package end-to-end.

### Added

- Squad MCP capability instructions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`): Capability Map, Capability Hint Contract, Graceful Degradation, Out-of-Band Fallbacks, and Consumer Override sections so dispatched roles can prefer an MCP when present and fall back to a named non-MCP default without blocking.
- Reference Azure DevOps MCP template (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`): documentation-only JSONC sample for the official `@azure-devops/mcp` server with managed Entra OAuth via VS Code `inputs`. The package never writes the consumer's `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- Squad Azure Architect agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-azure-architect.agent.md`): dispatched role for Azure architecture questions with the `architecture-docs` capability hint and a `learn.microsoft.com` fallback.
- Squad Cost Manager agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-cost-manager.agent.md`): dispatched role for Azure pricing questions with the `Azure-pricing` capability hint and an Azure Retail Prices REST fallback.

### Changed

- Pinned the mechanical-tier squad agents (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-cost-manager.agent.md`) to the Tier 1 model list (`Claude Haiku 4.5 (copilot)`, `GPT-5.4 mini (copilot)`) so routine state writes and lookups run on the cheapest capable models.
- Relocated the MCP reference template from `squad-src/.vscode/mcp.template.json` to `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`. The APM virtual-path validator rejects any path whose final segment begins with a dot, which blocked the previous `.vscode/` shipping location; the new path ships under the existing squad skill APM directory package.
- Reverted the now-unused `SquadDirectoryRoots` scaffold from `scripts/Update-ApmDependencies.ps1` and removed the corresponding `.vscode` virtual-path entry from `apm.yml`.
- Refreshed `apm.lock.yaml` against the latest `main` commit so the squad-src entries resolve to the merged squad capability upgrade.
- README install pins bumped from `v0.2.0` to `v0.3.0`.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-10

Adds a locally authored "squad" alongside the bundled HVE Core content.

### Added

- Squad Coordinator agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`): a user-invocable orchestrator that classifies a request, routes it to a cast of deployed HVE Core agents in parallel, and synthesizes the response.
- Squad Scribe agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`): the single writer of squad state, ensuring parallel dispatch cannot race on shared files.
- `/squad` prompt (`squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad.prompt.md`) to hand a request to the Squad Coordinator with optional `profile` and `tier` hints.
- `squad` skill (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/`) packaging the coordinator's operating procedure and seed templates.
- Three squad instruction files (`squad-roster`, `squad-routing`, `squad-state`) that auto-apply when squad state under `.copilot-tracking/squad/**` is touched.
- Squad profiles (`default`, `full`, `security`, `design`, `architecture`) so consumers can seed the cast that fits their project on first run.
- `scripts/Update-ApmDependencies.ps1` now enumerates the local squad source and emits squad entries as remote virtual paths, with `-SquadSourceRoot` and `-SquadRepoSlug` parameters.
- Squad virtual-path entries appended to `dependencies.apm` in `apm.yml`.
- README guidance for consumers on installing the package, running the squad, and building it.

### Changed

- `apm.lock.yaml` regenerated to reflect the current dependency set.
- `.gitignore` updated to keep the authored `squad-src/` tree tracked while ignoring deployed assets.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-10

Initial release of the `hve-squad` APM package.

### Added

- Curated APM package that bundles HVE Core agents, prompts, instructions, and skills for Copilot target environments.
- Auto-generated `dependencies.apm` list in `apm.yml` covering supported markdown artifacts from selected `microsoft/hve-core` folders (`.github/agents`, `.github/instructions`, `.github/prompts`, `.github/skills`).
- `scripts/Update-ApmDependencies.ps1` dependency generator.
- `sync-deps` and `install-sync` APM scripts for the maintainer workflow.
- `apm.lock.yaml` resolved dependency lock file for reproducible installs.
- README documenting maintainer and consumer workflows, including direct install from the public repository.
